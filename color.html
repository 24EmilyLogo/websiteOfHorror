        <h2>Why does color matter?</h2>
        <p>
            As with any art, video, and or design, color matters. 
            Having colors can help get the feeling the makers want the audience to feel accross without having to use words.
            Color also changes the overall tone of the scene to make the scene more coherent.
            There are many ways to handle coloring and many ways to experiment with colors.
            (Quick sidenote: There a lot of different colors that mean death especially with context. Have fun with it and experiment!)
            Here are some ideas of how color hasve been used in horror if you need somewhere to start: 
        </p>
        <section class="colors">
            <div>
                <h2>Red:</h2>
                <p>
                    Red has been associated with anger or passion. 
                    It's also the color of human blood, can be used to "highlight" fear 
                    and be useful to present the antagonist as a threat. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Orange:</h2>
                <p>
                    Orange has been associated with false hope. 
                    It can pair well with red and change from red to orange quickly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Yellow</h2>
                <p>
                    Yellow has been associated with premonition and a character losing control oneself.
                    Yellow can also foreshadow a tragedy that will happen to a character or from an event.
                    It's also been used to represent hope.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Green:</h2>
                <p>
                    Green has been associated with sickness, death, and decay.
                    It can invoke feelings of disgust. Mint can give feelings of unease.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Blue:</h2>
                <p>
                    Blue has been associated with cold, being lost, trapped, and also death.
                    It can help keep the audience thinking about there being no escape.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Purple:</h2>
                <p>
                    Purple has been associated with bad dreams.
                    It can add a surreal feeling to psychological horror.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Black:</h2>
                <p>
                    Black has been associated with death and darkness.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>White:</h2>
                <p>
                    White can be associated with innocence, both having it and losing it. It also is used for contrast.
