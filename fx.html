        <h2>What are practical and computer generated effects?</h2>
        <p>
            Practical effects are physical effects created by something other than a computer. 
            Where as computer generated effects are digitally applied effects after the footage has been taken.
            Practical effects are good because it's easier to react to something you can feel or see in process.
            On the other hand, digital effects are good because digital effects can clean up any messy takes.
            It's best to use both because there is a base for the digital from the practical effects.
            Also any mistakes made in the practical effect take can be cleaned up and look smoother and more closer to the end goal.
            Below is a good video that goes a bit more in depth about the process and if you scroll down farther I have a tutorial for fake bruises.
